Calculator project for The Odin Project's Foundations course

## Overview

A simple calculator that preforms basic operations.

## Reflections

I'm in the middle of moving right now, so this project took me a lot
longer than I would have liked. Regardless, working through this helped
reenforce a lot of concepts and techniques that I had previously been
confused about. For example, I spent a lot of time in my browser's dev
tools and had to use the debugger and breakpoints for the first time.
I'm also getting more used to recognizing when it's time to git commit.
On prior projects I wasn't committing often enough, and when I was I
had made too many changes to the code for any potential rollback to be
beneficial. This time I made sure to commit after each change in
functionality. As far as the nuts and bolts go, there were times when I
felt my code was pretty rickety and could fall apart at any moment,
but I was able to refactor when things went wrong, even if it did feel
a bit like spinning plates at times. I definitely needed to look up a
few things to get the ball rolling, but I pretty quickly understood
what I needed to be doing to get things to work properly. I spent a lot
of time fixing bugs, and there are probably more still to uncover, but
it felt pretty good to see the calculator working as intended knowing I
built it from scratch.
